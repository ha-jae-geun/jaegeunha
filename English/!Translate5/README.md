## 🔍 would와 could 올바르게 이해하고 자연스럽게 사용하는 법
* 문법적으로 could는 can의 과거형이라고 볼 수는 있습니다. 
* 
* 하지만, 정확한 뉘앙스/영어적 쓰임으로 파악하자면, 
* could의 정확한 뉘앙스는 
* “(예전에)~할 수도 있었어.(실제론 일어나지 않음)”정도의 의미로써, 일어나지 않은 사실에 대해서 말할 때 씁니다.
* 
* 예를 들어서..
* 나 고등학교때 진짜 잘생겨서.. 나 인기 진짜 많았지. 우리학교에 그 진짜 예뻤던 퀸카가 있었는데 그 여학생하고도 사귈 수 있었을걸? (진짜로 사귄건 아님)
* 이런 뉘앙스일 때 과거에 할 수 있었다는 의미로 could를 쓸 수 있습니다. (그리고 옥스퍼드 사전에서 말하는 시제의 일체를 위해서 쓰기도 하고요. 사전에서의 뉘앙스도 위의 뉘앙스와 비슷합니다.)
* 
* 하지만,
* I could get up early yesterday. (x)
* 이렇게 쓸 수는 없습니다. 왜냐하면, 이미 명확하게 일어난/있었던 사실에 대해 “나 어제 일어날 수 있었지”라는 말로는 뉘앙스적으로 안 맞는 표현이기 때문입니다.
* 
* 그렇기 때문에
* I was able to get up yesterday. (o)
* 가 정확하게 맞는 말입니다. 왜냐하면 실제로 어제 일어난 사실에 대해서 말하기 때문입니다.


## should와 have to의 차이 그리고 be supposed to
* I thought it would rain today
* She promised that she souldn't talk about that
* i toold him i would try my best
* I thought you knew about it; 아는 줄 알았어; 상태
* i thought you woould know about that; 알 줄 알았어
* i didn't think i could make it on time; 실제 결과와 반대를 예쌍
* i knew i couldn't arrive on time; 예상을 못했다는 것을 의미
* I could 단독: ~을 할 수도 있따; can의 불확실한 버전
* I would help you
---
* could 는 can의 과거형이 아닙니다. 조동사는 시제 변화를 하지 않습니다. 용례로는 쓰일지 몰라도 결코 과거형이 아닙니다. could가 과거형이라면 과거분사형은?﻿
* 1. have to- 단순의무 (부정적인 의미가 약간내포)  ~해야한다 
* 2. should - 개인적인생각/충고  ~하는게좋겠어, ~하는게 날거같아
* 3. be supposed to - 전통, 상식적인 기준,관습, 법, 정책, 규정에 의한 책임  ~ 해야되 ~해야한다 (뭔가의 기준에의해)
* 
* 1.don't have to - ~안해도되, ~할필요가없어
* 2. shouldn't - ~하지 않는게 좋겠어
* 3. be not supposed to- 기준에의해 ~하면안된다

* I shouldn't wait for the  bussiness trip.
* you should be more patient that.I'm supposed to read a book that she recommended.

-----------
* 이 비됴 끝까지 안 봤지만, 저는 미쿡에 살아요. would, could는 현재형이에요. 현재형인데 현재의 실제 상태와는 반대이거나. 아니면 현재의 상황과 반대로 소망하는거나 그런일이 일어났으리라는 마치 가정법이구요. can의 과거형은 was able to~ 이구, will의 과거형은 was going to~쓰시믄 돼유~근데 엄밀히 말해 will과 is going to는 의미가 같지는 않아요. will은 마치 군대에서 쓰는 용어 처럼 "꼭하겠슴돠" 라는 강한 실천의지가 들어간 의미이고, is going to는 자연스런 미래에 일어날일의 의미이지요~ ^^ 꿀럭!!﻿could 시제 종결해드립니다. 의미에 따라 시제가 달라집니다.
-----------
* 더 많은 뜻이 있지만 주로 쓰이는 3가지 의미를 분류해보면,
* * 1. possibility (in the present / future) ; 가능성
* 2. ability (in the past) ; 능력
* 3. permission (in the past) ; 허락
* 
* 1번만 현재/미래형 시제이며 (can보다 가능성 낮은 추측), 과거형 ~했었을것이다로 표현하고 싶으면 could have p.p. 하시면 됩니다.
*   ex) he couldn't be okay with the problem. 그는 그 문제로 괜찮지 않을것이다. (현재의 가능성)
* 
* 2,3번은 과거형 시제이며 이게 바로 can의 과거 의미로 이해할 수 있습니다.
* 특히 2번의 could가 자주 쓰이는데, was able to를 혼동하기 쉽습니다. 차이는 이렇습니다.
* - was able to는 1)과거에 실제로 일어난 'single events'(사건)을 가리킵니다.
* 2)아래의 could뜻을 포함합니다.
*  (was able to는 1번 뜻 or could의 의미로 사용되므로 의미가 더 넓습니다)
* - could는 과거의 어떤 '능력'을 말하는 것일뿐, 그것을 실제로 했는지를 말하는게 아닙니다. 즉 ~했었다가 아닌 ~ 할수 있었던 그 사람/사물의 상태를 의미합니다. 강력한 예문 하나 드리겠습니다.
*   ex) I could speak 2 languages when I was 5. 나는 5살때 2개국어를 할 수 있었다. (과거의 능력)
*   이것은 2개국어를 했던 사건을 얘기하는게 아니라, 그 사람의 능력(상태)를 말합니다.
* 물론 was able to도 그러한 의미로 쓰일 수 있으므로 바꿔 쓸 수 있습니다.
* 
* 예외) 2번 의미의 could + 지각동사(feel, smell ..) or 생각동사(think, understand ..) 는 과거의 능력과 과거의 사건 둘다 의미합니다.
* 어떤것을 느낄수 있는 능력이 있었다는것은 그것을 했다고 볼수 있기때문입니다. 그래서 아래처럼 바꿔 쓸 수 있습니다
* ex) I could hear something behind me = I was able to hear something ~. (과거의 ability / events)﻿
